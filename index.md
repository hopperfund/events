##Why should you care?

We want and need as many smart people as possible working in technology. This includes women and people from other communities, such as Māori, Pasifika, LGBTQI, and disabled groups. Right now, we're doing a bad job of this.

Events in our industry are often unpleasant for women, sometimes to the point of being hostile.

If you're running an event in the technology space (or any STEM area), you have a duty to our community to make your event as welcoming as possible to all of our community.

##How do you fix it?

There's no magic fix for this stuff, but you can take steps to gradually improve. You have to want to do it, though!

It's important to not leave this stuff until too late, but even if you have, there's stuff you can do -- just don't  expect a magical fix and be honest with your audience that you still have work to do.

There's two aspects to this: Making the changes to your event, both in the preparation and on-the-day delivery, and communicating with your attendees/potential attendees that you've made the changes to your event. 

Both are important - if women and other minority groups don't know you've changed, or can't see a clear signal of your intent, they're likely to err on the side of caution and stay away. That's not a judgement on you, or your event; it's caution learned from lots of other experiences.

Communicating the changes also helps to transfer ownership of your event's atmosphere and culture to your audience. It's really important that they understand and back your changes, as they're the ones whose actions will, in the end, shape how the event feels for attendees, and its ongoing success.

##Proper Preparation Prevents...

###Your Organising Team

If you don't already have a woman on your organising team, it's a good idea to add one, and not just in a token role. They'll help to bring perspectives you won't see, and it'll also send a clear message that your team cares about inclusivity.

Make sure your event staff for the day are a mix of genders (and ideally races too), so that people feel comfortable approaching your staff.

###Set a target

Before you start, it's important to define what success looks like for your event. This doesn't have to be something you share externally, although it can be a good way of holding yourself accountable for improvement. 

Understand the potential audience for your event: 

- What does the professional and student workforce look like in terms of diversity? 
- What were the stats from previous events for both speakers and attendees.
- What do you want to achieve this time?

Sometimes it can be hard to assess this data, but you may be able to get an indication of previous gender splits from t-shirt selections.

Check out [this data from WikiNZ](http://wikinewzealand.org/?graph=000601) on diversity in tech occupations in NZ from the 2013 census.

You can download the source data to refine it more for your audience. As census data, it is, of course, self-categorised, so be aware of any biases that may arise, but it may be useful in helping you understand your potential audience.

###Ask for help

Most communities are willing to help if you ask early in your process, whether that's taking a look over your plans to see if there's any obvious red-flags, or by helping you with outreach to access a more diverse speaker set. 

> Some of these people are asked for help a lot, and generally most organisers expect this to be free. Consider offering to recompense them in some way.

###Think about ticketing

Pricing and ticketing is hard. Bottom line: you have to cover your costs. However, price is a huge barrier, not just with tickets, but for accommodation, transport, childcare, and more.

There are some creative ways you can make your event more accessible:

- Partner with a sponsor/sponsors to offer scholarships to help diverse attendees. This could cover tickets, accommodation, transport, or any combination of these.
- Allow individual sponsorship.
	- 1 + 1 tickets (buy a ticket for you, and a ticket for us to allocate to a women or attendee from another marginalised group.
	- Offer 'pay more if you want' to chip in to help cover minority speaker/attendee costs.
- Offer student tickets (student must present valid ID at registration desk).

###Your T-shirts

T-shirts are hugely popular event swag. They're a walking advertisement for how much people love your event. However, they're also really awful if not done well - poorly fitted shirts in inadequate size ranges exclude attendees.

Here's some basics:

- Offer mens and womens style shirts. Never do unisex ones. Unisex actually means mens.
- Call them 'straight fit' and 'curvy fit', rather than 'mens' and 'womens' because not all men want mens shirts and not all women want womens shirts.
- Include a size guide, not just a list of sizes. This means chest measurements. Usually, your supplier will have these. Either link to theirs, or code up your own. Don't skip it.
- Offer as wide a range of shirts as possible, even if it means working with 2 suppliers to extend the range into larger sizes. It is really hard to find women's plus size tees, but [these people have some](http://www.wholesaletshirtsnz.com/category/ladies-womens-t-shirts-auckland).
- If you can't offer a full range of sizes, include a 'no-shirt' option. No, women don't want another men's t-shirt as a nightie.
- Consider your print design. Women and men have different body shapes, and some designs are just plain bad when placed on a bust, including:
	- Anything with potential to be a double-entendre.
	- Wording that encourages people to stare closely at bust level.
	- Vertical lines that distort when placed over a larger bust.
	- Designs that sit too low so fall on underside of bust.

###Partner events

Conferences are big events, and can be a bit overwhelming. Sometimes, arranging a partner event with a local organisation can be a great way to make your event more welcoming and help your attendees build a stronger network.

Some events that may work well:

- A Girl Geek Dinners event the same week. Talk to [@ggdnz](https://twitter.com/ggdnz).
- A partner learn-to-code event, like [Rails Girls Wellington](https://twitter.com/railsgirlswgtn) or [Auckland](https://twitter.com/railsgirlsakl).
- A pre-conference breakfast women's meet-up at a local café. You can add an option for this on the registration form, and then make a group table booking, or simply set up a separate meetup booking page.
- Offer a new attendee meet-and-greet.

###Speakers

If you want a diverse audience, you need to start with what you're selling them. If you're a conference, that's your speakers.

Aim for a diverse line up, and not just gender diversity. Ideally, try for 50/50 gender diversity, but also consider racial diversity, age diversity and other forms of diversity. Different perspectives are important, not just for appearances sake, but because they can truly add to your event, and make the experience richer for all attendees.

Be prepared for arguments from people who will tell you that you're diluting your quality for the sake of appearance. These people are wrong. 

You are broadening the pool of speakers you're considering to counter the natural advantages white male speakers gain from existing networks. There are many, many talented speakers who are not white men. You're doing your audience a favour by not looking at the same pool of speakers everyone else does.

> What not to do: Release your all-white, all-male speaker line up, and when people call you out on your lack of diversity, approach a couple of women at the last minute, and then blame them when they turn you down.

####Selection Methods

Different events choose speakers using different methods. Generally, you'll either be hand-picking speakers, or using a CFP, or a combination of the two.

Before doing anything else, stop and go and [read this by Sarah Milstein, who is doing this exceptionally well](http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/01/theres-no-excuse-for-all-white-male-panels/).

You probably didn't click the link, so here's the Cliff's Notes:

1. As a leader, commit yourself to improving your selection process.
2. Be deeply transparent.
3. Look beyond the usual suspects. 
4. Offer speaker training.
5. Request help.
6. Approach individual people in your under-represented groups. 
7. Have a farm system. 
8. Save slots — as many as half — for people you find later in the process.
9. Take chances. 

I can't highlight enough the importance of transparency. People respect honesty, and yet it's one of the most frightening things for us to do when running an event or a business. Be honest if you haven't done well at this in the past. Be honest about what you're trying to do to get better, and about the mistakes you'll make along the way (you'll make them, we all do).

> **Important**: Be up front about what, if any, pay or assistance speakers can expect, including flights, accommodation, childcare etc. Some speakers may not wish to take you up on these - it's a great idea to offer the option of donating this back into a scholarship pool, for example.

####Hand-picking speakers

In theory, hand-picking speakers should be easy, right? Write down a list of people you want. Make it half men, half women, and make sure it's not all white folks. In reality, it's always more complicated than that. People will always decline for myriad reasons, but here's some things to consider:

- Impostor syndrome. [It's a real thing](https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor), and it's important to understand.
- A surprising number of women who you consider to be awesome will think they're not good enough, especially if they haven't presented at an event of your scale or type before. Be polite but persistent; explain why you want them to speak.
- There's often less visible/prominent women speakers. You may not be the only people to approach them that week, or even that day. Make your request compelling, but also consider who else you could approach. They may have a recommendation for another woman if they cannot speak, or there are women's speaker networks, although these are less common in NZ. If you're really stuck, we might be able to help you find someone. Generally, people want to help, provided you don't leave it until the last minute.
- Offer speaker coaching in your initial email, either remotely, or in person, or a combination of both.   
- Include a clear outline of what your event is about:
	- Who is your audience.
	- What do you want them to get out of the day.
	- What you think this speaker will add to the event.
	- What level they should pitch their talk at.
- Leave plenty of time for back and forth. A lot of time - start making your dream list months in advance, and if possible, build relationships with people over coffees or at meet ups.
- Make your list of women longer than your list of men. When some of the women at the top of your list say no, or drop out (they will, it happens, although it's less likely if you have a crèche), you'll have a backup plan already thought out and will be less likely to go for a man instead.
- Make sure it's clear that you're professional in your approach to AV. If you're a woman, standing in front of a room full of people, and a conference has an awful AV set up that you have to wrestle with, the crowd assumes it's because girls suck at IT. That's not a nice feeling. You can remove this anxiety by:
	1. Having a great AV team who are good at this stuff.
	2. Making sure the people you're approaching to speak know it. Assure them that their slides will be tested at least 48 hours before the event, and they will have the opportunity to run through their slides at the venue with the audio equipment and slide controls before speaking. This seems small, but it makes a big difference.

####Running a CFP

This can be harder to get right than self-selection. You cannot simply assume that just because you've decided to make an effort that things will get better and that people will realise that. You might like to consider a mix of speaker selection (focussed on women and other minority groups) and a CFP to begin with.

The biggest mistake people make with a CFP is assuming people know as much about their event as they do, and that everyone will flock to speak at their event. There is a glaring problem with this approach: it means the people who respond to your event's CFP will be fanboys: people who have attended before, who know the event inside and out and who represent your existing audience. They're extremely unlikely to help you achieve your goal of broadening your speaker list.

You need to think about the barriers to application that potential speakers might face and address these in your CFP clearly and concisely. CFPs are like job applications - Women are less likely to apply unless they think they meet all the criteria - they're socialised to be risk-averse. If the criteria are hidden, they're a lot less likely to apply. Men are socialised to take risks.

If you're running a CFP, you'll need to work harder to get the word out that you're looking for speakers from a diverse range of backgrounds.

Here's some things you can try:

- Ask awesome people to apply directly - via a tweet or an email. Help them to see what you see in them.
- Ask them (or the rest of your community) to recommend and introduce you to other talented speakers from diverse backgrounds.
- Build relationships with leaders in minority communities. 
- Talk to Girl Geek Dinners, Gather Workshops, Rails Girls or other events. Their speakers, coaches and mentors can be great speakers for you.
- Go to local meet ups, especially women-in-tech ones. Get to know them. 
- Consider paying someone, or several people to do diversity outreach work for your event to encourage women and other minority groups to submit proposals to speak. 
- Run an open FAQ session via Google Hangouts or similar.

It's also really important that your CFP is really great.

Make it clear what you are looking for and what criteria you will be using to assess applications.

Include:

- What your conference is about. Don't assume they've attended. Don't copy the blurb from your website. If you're adding new streams this year that are a departure from previous years, make sure you elaborate on what these are and why you're adding them.
- Who your audience is:
    - demographics.
    - are they corporate, startup, non-profit/NGO, government etc.
- What value you're hoping the event/conference will provide to your audience.
- What style of talks you generally accept (technical, inspirational, case studies etc).
- What method of submission you expect the applicant to use. Include detailed technical information here. It will save you time later.
- What information to include.
- What information not to include.
- Links to past talks (if available and applicable) for applicants to get a feel for your event.
- Timeframes for responses.
- Your assessment process and when they should expect to hear from you.
- Whether you offer assistance for travel, accommodation, tickets, or other assistance, or if there are scholarships available for this.
- A contact point for questions. If your CFP is good enough, you hopefully won't get as many, but this can help a lot.
- Whether you have speaker mentoring available.

Get someone who has never attended your conference to read your CFP. They don't need to even work in the same industry. See if they understand what you're looking for and can explain back to you in clear terms what they think you expect your applicants to do. If they can't, you've still got some work to do.
 
Remember, submitting to a CFP can be a lot of work and can be daunting, especially for someone who has not spoken a lot. Respect their time and make your requirements clear. This will also save you time by improving the quality of applications.


#####Selecting the Speakers

Blind selection is a great technique to use to remove bias. Many biases we hold are implicit (in other words, we don't even realise we have them).

In a blind selection process, all details for the submitting speakers are anonymised, and the speakers are assessed on their own merits.

!!Con shared the details of their anonymising process. I'm going to summarise that here:

1. Allocate 1 or 2 people to complete the initial application review. These people will be responsible for removing all identifiable details from the application, and summarising any content such as video applications. These people will not be further involved in the selection process.
2. Applications are passed to the assessing team. Each team member reads every application and assigns it a grade from A to D (A being 'I will fight for this to be accepted' and D being 'I will fight for this to be rejected'). If you know who a submission is from, refrain from grading.
3. The highest and lowest grade for each talk are then combined to give a ranking 'AA, AB, AC, AD, BB, BC, BD, CC, CD, DD'. Any talk without an A is rejected (adjust this based on how harsh your grading is)
4. The proposals are sorted into categories, and if someone feels strongly enough to advocate for or against a talk, that talk is tagged for discussion.
5. Proposals with an advocate are then discussed with the group, and considered in the framework of a potential conference program. Decisions are then made about accepting or rejecting these talks.
6. The original 1-2 people then send results and feedback to the applicants. As the people who had watched the videos and read other content, they are in a great position to combine the all the feedback into a great personal response to rejected applicants that still highlights what parts of the application they had loved, and encourages applicants to keep submitting to your conference and other conferences in the future.

##Conference environment - venue, audience, code of conduct

The conference environment, from the venue, to food, to the atmosphere, is a huge factor in your event being welcoming to attendees from marginalised groups. Some of this you can control, and some of it is behaviour/culture you need to encourage (and set an expectation for) from your attendees.

###Venue selection

This can be a hard one, as there are many other factors to weigh in - everything from cost to availability and more.

When you're assessing venues, here's a checklist of things to consider which can impact on how welcoming your event is to marginalised groups.

####Bathrooms

This is incredibly important for attendees with non-binary gender identities.

- At least some single-occupancy, gender-neutral bathrooms. 
- This means no 'womens' and 'mens' designation, and no grouped waiting area. 
- Ensure that the availability of these is clearly communicated. 
- Ensure adequate disabled bathrooms.

####Accessibility 

Your venue needs to be accessible to people in wheelchairs, on crutches, or with other physical disabilities. 

Many venues state that they are 'accessible', but the accessible route provides a degraded experience that is not communicated or factored into event planning. You need to:

- Ask to be shown the accessible access-ways.
- Walk through the event experience from that perspective - ensure they are unimpeded (unlocked, clear etc). 
- This includes any related events, like drinks/after-parties. 
- Check if there a suitable amount of wheelchair-friendly seating space both in and out of the auditoriums.
- Consider whether attendees get to all necessary areas (registration, talks, food, bathrooms) in a reasonable time and whether you're happy with that entrance being their impression of your event. 
- Check if there is enough seating in break-out spaces for those who are pregnant or tire easily. 
- Consider whether [speakers can access the stage](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/unlocking-the-invisible-elevator-accessibility-at-tech-conferences).

####Catering

Check if they can provide for dietary requirements in an acceptable way. This means: 

- Catering to people with coeliac disease and other allergies, vegetarians, vegans, religious needs, including halal and kosher, and more. 
- Check the food-service plans - it's much harder to feed people with dietary needs if wait-staff are taking food around a room. 
- If food is served buffet-style, try give people with dietary requirements access first. Often, serving implements get messed up and cross-contamination occurs, or the only food they can eat is consumed by other people.
- If you can't cater for these, let the attendees know as soon as possible, and consider refunding a portion of the ticket cost. 
- Help them by identifying local restaurants and food places that cater for their dietary requirements, and consider offering them access to a fridge on-site to store their own food.
- If you're providing special meals, try not to make a big deal of it. Quietly communicate with the people where they should be to receive their meal so they understand what the process is. Imagine your event at maximum chaos; you probably won't be able to reliably track down these people, so ensure that this is communicated at check-in (preferable) or through clear signage (last resort). Remember that signage that is too low down will not be able to be seen through a crowd.

####Deaf access

Does anything in your venue preclude you from catering to Deaf attendees? Ideally, you need to be able to: 

- Offer NZSL translation. 
- Support this with adequate stage space/technical infrastructure. 
- Support wireless headphones for the sound system.
- Consider also people with intersecting disabilities (e.g. Deaf and wheelchair access). Can the venue support this?
- Offer printed or digital copies of slides to these attendees. Often, they'll miss the slide while watching the sign translation.
- [Consider offering real-time captioning](http://composition.al/blog/2014/05/31/your-next-conference-should-have-real-time-captioning/).


####Room for extra facilities 

Does the venue have room to support extra facilities like: 

- Speakers lounge.
- Quiet/retreat space.
- Crèche.
- Emergency-room, where someone can be taken if they've been harassed, are having a panic attack, or similar.


###Crèche

Offering on-site childcare is becoming increasingly common. It makes your event a lot more accessible if you can offer to look after kids, especially under 5's, while talks are on.

As far as we can establish, NZ Childcare Centre Legislation doesn't apply to one-off crèches.\*

Services that may help:

- [Relief teacher agency](http://www.randstad.co.nz).
- Ask around on Twitter, especially for events in weekends or holidays. If you're paying, there may be teachers willing to help.
- Contact us at <hello@hopper.org.nz> if you need help with toy supply/hire. We may be able to assist.
- [Face painting, balloon twisting and character entertainment for children](http://www.fabfaces.co.nz).

\*We're not lawyers, so do check with one of them.

###Alcohol

It's really important to consider the impact of alcohol at both your event, and accompanying events, such as after parties.

Many events fail to adequately cater to the many people who do not drink, offering only plain sodas and orange juice.

These are some of the people you'll exclude by focussing your event around alcohol:

- Under 18s (or 21s in the US).
- People whose religions prohibit drinking.
- Recovering alcoholics.
- People who choose not to drink or don't drink for health reasons.
- Pregnant women.
- Contributes to an environment where women are more likely to feel unsafe.

To make your event more welcoming:

- Ensure you have at least an equal number of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Remember that people who drink will also likely consume the non-alcoholic beverages. Include mocktails if you're serving cocktails.
- Display these drinks in the same location. Don't make non-drinkers go off to a special bar/spot to get their drink.
- Consider the venue for after parties if alcohol is involved. Is it close to public transport routes?
- Make sure there are safe ways for attendees to get home (organise cabs etc).
- Advertise you're doing this! It makes your event more welcoming to non-drinkers.

###Your team

Your team are an incredibly important part of how welcoming your event is. You should aim for your team on the day to be representative of your intended audience - in other words, you want a diverse team, as well as a diverse audience.

It's super important for attendees to be able to easily find your team. It's a good idea to provide your team with event t-shirts to wear. However, it's really important that you cater for ALL shapes and sizes when doing this, and that you communicate this requirement in advance.

If you can't cater for all sizes, provide an alternative - give a lot of notice of the colour, and consider providing a budget for staff who cannot be catered for to find something suitable in that colour, for example.

Your staff should all be trained on the basics, including:

- Using chosen gender pronouns, or using neutral gender pronouns.
- Not using sexist, ableist, cis-sexist, or homophobic language. For example, 'tranny', 'lame', 'retarded', 'gypped'.
- Managing your code of conduct.
- Looking after the needs of any attendees who have special requirements, such as disabilities or different food requests.

##Code of Conduct 

_This section shamelessly borrows from the excellent folks at the Geek Feminism Wiki_

For some people, a code of conduct is a bit of a swear word. Many people have the illusion that the purpose of a code of conduct is to prevent any instance of bad behaviour at the event. 

Some people also believe that if they have never had an issue reported at their event, they do not need a code of conduct, and to have one implies the event has problems. 

A code of conduct does neither of these things. It exists to:

- Inform your speakers and attendees of the standard of behaviour you expect.
- Send a clear message to marginalised groups, including women, that their presence is welcome and you are thinking of their safety and comfort.
- Give you a framework to train your staff and volunteers around.
- Highlight channels to report issues on should they arise.
- Build trust that you will support women or other complainants if an issue did arise.

Having a code of conduct doesn't guarantee good behaviour, but it tells people you care, and that they can come to you with a problem and trust you to deal with it appropriately.

###What to include

There are many example code of conducts and anti-harassment policies available. We recommend starting with the Geek Feminism wiki's example policy, which has a CC-zero licence, meaning you can use and adapt it as you wish.

If you're new to this, it can be a good idea to stick pretty close to the original. However, there are some excellent examples of conferences adapting the policy language to their own personal brand - check out Kiwicon's example.

- [Geek Feminism Wiki Template](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)
- [Kiwicon Conference](https://kiwicon.org/faq/code-of-conduct/) and [FAQs](https://kiwicon.org/faq/#q9)
- [Gather Conference](http://gathergather.co.nz/gatherly-behaviour/)

It's not a great idea to completely roll your own. It's tempting to just go with 'Be nice', but unfortunately, most people's definition of 'nice' is pretty varied, and doesn't align with your own or that of marginalised people in your community. 'Be nice' is really hard to enforce when things go wrong, and doesn't give people who've been burned before a lot of confidence.

###Where to display it

Once you've written it, you need to display it. Here's some ideas of where you might like to put it:

- On your website. And not just a small link in your footer.
- As part of your ticketing process. You should make your attendees confirm they've read it. Yes, this is like confirming you've read the terms and conditions, so many of them won't, but it's worth a shot, and it also covers your butt because they had to tell you they accepted those terms when they bought the ticket.
- As part of your CFP and speaker approach/prep materials. It's important your speakers understand this applies to them also - both in regards to their talk content and slides, and their behaviour at the event.
- As part of your sponsorship prep packages if your sponsors are going to have staff attending (comp tickets, for example) or are going to have displays or collateral at your event. Their brand is associated with your brand at your event.
- In the pre-conference email you're going to be excitedly sending out in the weeks leading up to the event. It's just as important to remind your attendees that you care about their safety as it is about the amazingly cool shit they're going to see.
- As part of the event swag, either in the booklet or on their lanyard card.
- On posters around the venue.

###Introducing your event and your code of conduct

At the beginning of your (undoubtedly excellent) event, you'll probably be welcoming your attendees and setting the scene for your conference. It's really important to discuss your code of conduct at this time. You need to:

- Mention you have a code of conduct.
- Provide a brief breakdown of it, such as "[event name] is committed to being a harassment-free space. Harassment of any form, including sexism, racism, transphobia and ableism is unacceptable. This includes verbal comments, unwanted physical attention, photography, stalking and more. Our full code of conduct is available on our website and [other places like event booklet]."
- Give ownership of the environment to the attendees - "we rely on you to make this an amazing place. If you notice anything you think is inappropriate, please say something or speak to one of our team".
- Ensure reporting channels are clear "any of our team can help you if you'd like to report a breach of our code of conduct. You can find them by [details]".

###Training your team before the event

Fortunately, many times you will not have any incidents that need to be managed. However, in the event of one occurring, in order for a code of conduct to be effective, your team needs to know how to implement it. 

Crisis management is only effective if staff know exactly how to handle reports. Otherwise, the situation may inadvertently be escalated.

In general, you should designate a person/people as the official code of conduct points. These people should not be the main event organisers, as the organisers will typically be too busy with main event details to manage the initial report.

You should assign a room as a safe room where anyone in distress or who wants to discuss a confidential code of conduct-related manner can be taken. This room might also double as a first-aid room, but should not be your general "quiet room", as privacy is important. Ideally, it should be separate from the main/busy conference area, and have minimal windows, or curtained windows.

###General Staff Training

####Presentation issues

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although a member of conference staff should speak to the presenter afterward. You, or a staff member, may like to acknowledge the issue at the conclusion of the talk. This can be as simple as "I'm sorry for the inappropriate comment in that presentation. I'd like to remind everyone of our code of conduct".

However, staff should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no further explanation. You may later choose to issue a statement, either verbally or in writing about the incident.

You should also try to assign a person to watch all talks and also the conference hashtags and Twitter feeds. This person is responsible for monitoring talks and Twitter for potential issues, and ensuring any concerns raised are promptly responded to. The role of this person is not to enter into discussions on whether the conduct was right or wrong, merely to acknowledge any complaints and ensure they are immediately escalated to the official code of conduct point for investigation.

Make sure this person understands that [their job is not to get defensive](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/how-to-not-make-a-bad-situation-worse).

####Recommended response:

"Thanks for letting us know. We'll follow this up."

####Receiving a report

Anyone in your team must be able to take a report from a conference attendee. Reports must be taken for all incidents, regardless of the level of details the complainant is able to provide (including not being able to identify offending parties)

This report should: 

- Never be taken in a public area where other attendees can overhear.
- Never be taken in the presence of the offending party.

When taking a report, your team member should:

- Record what they say.
- Reassure them they are being taken seriously.
- Avoid making specific promises about what actions the organisers will take.
- Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place), but do not pressure them if they are not willing or able to provide it.
- Offer to provide them with an update if requested.

> **Important**: You should _never_ demand proof from the victim, engage in any form of victim-blaming behaviour (such as implying they were leading them on, or were too drunk), or advise the victim that you must hear 'both sides of the story'. Don't judge the victim for what has happened.

Once the report has been taken, your team member should:

- Offer to locate friend/family/support person.
- Arrange for an escort by conference staff or a trusted person.
- Offer to contact law enforcement.
- Offer to contact support services, such as rape crisis, if applicable.

> **Important**: Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members.

####Issuing verbal warnings

Every member of your team has ownership for conference safety and should feel confident issuing warnings to attendees, presenters, or other staff members for inappropriate behaviour.

All verbal warnings should also be reported to a central location as soon as possible, typically via text message or email.

####Documenting a reported incident

A report should be made of any breaches of the code of conduct, whether they are reported by attendees, or a result of verbal warnings issued by staff for observed behaviour. 

Reports should include as much of the following as possible:

- Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant.
- The time you issued the warning.
- The behaviour that was in violation.
- The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time of warning).
- The circumstances surrounding the incident.
- Your identity.
- Other people involved in the incident.

####Training for you or your code of conduct representative

Either you or your representative(s) will be responsible for managing the reported incidents. Before the event, you need to decide what courses of action can take for breaches. These can include:

- Warning or multiple warnings.
- Ejection from event for one day.
- Ejection from event for duration of event.
- Ejection from event and ban from x number of future events.
- Ejection and permanent ban from future events.

Generally, it is not recommended to facilitate a face-to-face apology in any form. This may:

- Re-traumatise the victim/other affected parties.
- In the case of a speaker, result in them making the situation worse.

> **Example**: Kiwicon, a security/hacker conference, has sparkly hula hoops to hang around the waist of people who make minor infractions (as well as a warning). These serve as a clear visual indicator that the person may not be safe, as well as providing a physical barrier to getting too close to another person.
>
> Note: Techniques such as this are not recommended for anything more than a minor infraction.

Your team should sit down before the event and agree what the appropriate courses of action are. These should be recorded in a table/chart that is easily available on the day.

You'll never be able to cover all potential outcomes, but having some guidelines in place will help to ensure you feel confident you're making the right decision and that you are backed by your team.

####After the event

If you have an incident at the event, you may need to complete some post-incident response management. Think of this like an outage post-mortem. Not every incident will warrant this, however high-profile incidents (removal of speakers, incidents that caused social media outcry) will likely benefit from this.

Generally this will cover:

- What went wrong.
- How you managed it.
- What lessons you learned for next time.

> **Important**: Public responses should be anonymised to protect the identities of the parties involved. The purpose of this report is to give you a chance to reflect and to reassure your community that you take your responsibilities seriously.

If you ejected a speaker or a sponsor, you'll likely need to follow up with them directly in writing.

Don't do this on the day, or even the day after. Give yourself a couple of days to get some sleep and calm down.

Then, calmly email them a brief explanation about why you took the action you did. Include a link to your code of conduct.
